    * Explore other options for HPC use (WHOI? NOAA?)
    * Always consider if this can be done with available computing resources. What is at GLERL and how do I access it?

    * Single year trials
    * Multiyear trials, new QC code at mcy (or other site as reccomended).
    * No avg.intensity QC vs avg.intensity QC
    * Will the model function better on more recent data? What about all data?

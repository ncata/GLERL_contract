Week of 06/27/2022

- OWG Project:
    * Assessed the Prepdata_glerl.ipynb code
        + Simplified file management process
        + Troubleshooted error messages resulting from directory overwriting
        + Applied code on all available years
        + Experimented with new QC approaches, est_sharpness function found to be redundant
    * Created Prepcsv_glerl.ipynb
        + Reused code from csv_interpolation.ipynb, interpolation is theorized to over filter the dataset
        + Rewrote functions to read .txt files and create .csv files
        + Identified time zone discrepancy (local vs UTC), this could have been the root cause of the csv_interpolation.ipynb issue

- Field:
    * Went to Toledo light to install Webcam and HAB sensor
    * Confirmed attendance on CSMI cruise with Ed Rutherford

- Misc:
    * Introduced myself to GLERL summer fellows at a luncha and learn meeting

- Looking ahead:
    * Work CSMI cruise
    * Run trials on OWG
    * Complete work on *_glerl notebook Code
    * Formalize code into python functions

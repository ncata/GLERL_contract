# GLERL Contract Activity Log - Nicholas Catanzaro 2022

## 06/23/2022: NOAA GLERL/remote

- 08:30: Plan daily tasks and check email
- 09:30: Arrive at GLERL. Review previous summer's code from SSF repo owg folder. Review recent ReCON webcam images. Update startup.docx tasks
- 10:00: Review figures from [Dan Buscombe's paper on OWG](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coastaleng.2019.103593). Plan edits to [Prepdata.ipynb](https://github.com/ncata/SSF/blob/main/OWG/Prepdata.ipynb)
- 11:00: Review potential owg sites on and off ReCON network in Lake Erie
- 12:00: Managed AWS account. Reached out to AWS about redeeming grant credits (OOO until July 4th). Began familiarizing myself with No Tears Cluster, general HPC terminology and usage, and requirements to ssh into a cluster in order to run jupyter. May be more useful to adapt .py scripts from Dan's OWG_DNN repo.
- 13:45: IT helps install software (Atom, Git, Anaconda)
- 14:00: Cloned glerl_owg repo to local machine. Created blank activitylog.txt, glerl_owg.yml, and startup_goals.txt files. Populated, committed, and pushed activitylog.txt to test repo.

    "The function below is specifically for the analysis of view \\#2 in MI City. This works with imagery from the old webcam location. It is designed for a proof of concept application of the OWG. This function will need to be adapted or rewritten to deal with contemporary datsets. Also, a record of the inputs to each version should be kept for research/repeatability purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Next Steps\n",
    "The most important additon that is needed is a way to automate the creation of view folders within the new year_imgprep folder. This could be done by including a list of numbers as strings representing the camera view as an input, or using string parsing and appending the target string-numbers into a list within the function. The latter option is likely best as it requires no additonal inputs be added to the funciton"
